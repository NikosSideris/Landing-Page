## Description

This is a project in the context of the Udacity's Frond-end Developer Nanodegree.

Given a starter project that had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. 
Asked to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one, modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Acknowledgements 

From from https://muffinman.io/javascript-get-element-offset/ got the function getElementOffset() for getting an element's coordinates in the window.

## Files

 2. app.js     --> the javascript file that makes the nav dynamic
 3. styles.css --> the CSS file that gives the styling to the landing page
